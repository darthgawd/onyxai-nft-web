## OnyxAI Web3

OnyxAI Web3 is a live demo showing how AI-generated images can be uploaded to IPFS and minted as NFTs using a fully non-custodial Phantom wallet flow.
Users generate an image, upload it, connect Phantom, and sign the mint themselves — the server never holds funds or ownership. 
This project demonstrates real Web3 principles in practice: wallet-signed transactions, user-owned assets, IPFS-based metadata, and clean AI + blockchain integration on Solana Devnet.
